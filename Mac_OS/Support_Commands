Setting Up the Environment
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv .venv
Creates a virtual environment named .venv in the current directory.

Activate the virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
source .venv/bin/activate
Activates the virtual environment for installing dependencies and running scripts.

Install required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
Installs the Python dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

File and Directory Operations
List files in a directory:

bash
Copy code
ls
Lists all files and directories in the current directory.

List detailed information of a file:

bash
Copy code
ls -l ./path/to/file
Shows detailed information (like permissions and size) of a specified file.

Move a file or directory:

bash
Copy code
mv /source/path /destination/path
Moves a file or directory to a new location.

Change file permissions:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x ./path/to/file
Makes a file executable.

Search for files with a specific name:

bash
Copy code
find /base/path -name "filename"
Searches for a file named filename starting from the specified base path.

Running Scripts
Run a shell script:

bash
Copy code
zsh ./path/to/script.zsh ./path/to/scene.ttt
Runs the specified .zsh script and passes a .ttt scene file as an argument.

Handle permission errors for a scene:

bash
Copy code
chmod +r ./path/to/scene.ttt
Gives read permissions to a .ttt file required by the CoppeliaSim script.

Python Script Execution
Run a Python script:
bash
Copy code
python send_commands.py
Runs the Python script send_commands.py to communicate with the CoppeliaSim server.
CoppeliaSim Setup
Verify a file path in the app structure:

bash
Copy code
ls ./coppeliaSim.app/Contents/MacOS/coppeliaSim
Verifies the existence of the main executable in the CoppeliaSim application package.

Start the simulation via a script:

bash
Copy code
zsh ./scripts/start_coppelia_sim.zsh ./scenes/Robobo_Scene.ttt
Launches the CoppeliaSim application with the specified scene file.

General Navigation
Navigate to a directory:

bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/directory
Moves to the specified directory.

View the current directory:

bash
Copy code
pwd
Prints the current working directory.

Summary of Key Fixes
CoppeliaSim Setup: Ensured the coppeliaSim.app was placed in the correct directory (full_project_setup) and adjusted file permissions for coppeliaSim and Robobo_Scene.ttt.
Virtual Environment: Created a Python venv and installed all required dependencies.
Communication Test: Verified Python-ZeroMQ communication with the send_commands.py script.
